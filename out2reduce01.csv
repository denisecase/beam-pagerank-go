Reduce to one record per key (a ranked web page)
   - add a count of the votes each page makes as you aggregate
   - and a list of which pages they vote for
   - provide initial page rank value

Read as:

"README.md, with a rank of 1.000 making 3 votes, is supported by a list of supporting pages."

Format will stay the same - rerun this reduce process - calculated ranks will converge.
