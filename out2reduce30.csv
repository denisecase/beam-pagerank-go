Rerun this process to recalculate PRs:

Output shows results of prior calculation:

PR(README.md) = 0.15 + 0.85(0.69693/1 + 0.69693/1 +0.69693/1) = 1.92717
PR(go.md) = 0.15 + 0.85(1.90919/3) = 0.69093
PR(java.md) = 0.15 + 0.85(1.90919/3) = 0.69093
PR(python.md) = 0.15 + 0.85(1.90919/3) 0.69093

Still total = 4? 

= 1.92717 + 0.69093 + 0.69093 + 0.69093 = 3.99996

Delta = abs(old-new)
|1.90919-1.92717| = 0.01798 = 0.9% which is < 1% ~= no change
|0.69693-0.69093| = 0.006 = 0.9% which is < 1% ~= no change

Can stop iterating at 1.93 and 0.69, 0.69, 0.69.
